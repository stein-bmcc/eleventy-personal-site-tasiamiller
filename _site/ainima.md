     AINIMA ANIME STREAMING SITE CONCEPT
  </h1>
  <p>
      For this assignment I was tasked with designing a Figma prototype for a responsive streaming website layout. I took inspiration from streaming sites I already use such as Viki, Netflix, and Crunchyroll. As for the name, I combined Ai or æ„›, is a Japanese word for love, with Anime: Ai(Love) + Anime = Ainima - a tribute to my love for the anime genre.
