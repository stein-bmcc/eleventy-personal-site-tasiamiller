<h1>
AINIMA ANIME STREAMING SITE CONCEPT
</h1>
<p>
For this assignment, I was tasked with designing a Figma prototype for a responsive streaming website layout. I took inspiration from streaming sites I already use such as Viki, Netflix, and Crunchyroll. I chose to focus on an anime streaming site because there is not one that has access to every anime out there and I wish for Ainima to represent that so you would not need 4000 subscriptions just to watch every show you wanted to see. As for the name, I combined Ai or æ„›, is a Japanese word for love, with Anime: Ai(Love) + Anime = Ainima - a tribute to my love for the anime genre.
