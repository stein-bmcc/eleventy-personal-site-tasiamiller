     Costa Rica Postcard Designs

  <p>
      I was tasked with designing a few postcards for Costa Rica using pictures my professor provided to the students in my graphic design course. I strived to create a balanced yet dynamic composition by cropping and arranging these images. I chose logos from the selection given to me that stood out the most against their respective background without overpowering the image completely.
