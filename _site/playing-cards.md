<h1>
Custom Playing Cards Designs
</h1>
<p>
I created a custom playing card game based on Anime characters and a mobile Otome game. For the anime characters, I chose Kurosaki Ichigo(黒崎 一護) from "Bleach(ブリーチ)" and Okumura Rin(奥村 燐) from "Blue Exorcist(青の祓魔師)" because they are some of my all-time favorite shounen protagonists and I wanted to give them a special highlight in my project, to explain why their card are a bit more embellished in comparison to the four otome game characters. The otome game characters come from a mobile game called "Obey Me! One master to rule them all" which is a game featuring the seven deadly sins as a set of demonic siblings. I chose these four because I was inspired by their character designs and wanted to implement their chibi versions. One of the goals of this project was to learn how to use the clipping mask tool in Adobe Illustrator.
