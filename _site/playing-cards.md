<h1>
Custom Playing Cards Designs
</h1>
<p>
I created a custom playing card game based on Anime characters and a mobile Otome game. For the anime characters, I chose Kurosaki Ichigo(黒崎 一護) from "Bleach(ブリーチ)" and Okumura Rin(奥村 燐) from "Blue Exorcist(青の祓魔師)" because they are some of my all-time favorite shounen protagonists and I wanted to give them a special highlight in my project, to explain why their card are a bit more embellished in comparison to the four otome game characters. The otome game characters come from a mobile game called "Obey Me! One master to rule them all" which is a game featuring the seven deadly sins as a set of demonic siblings. I chose these four because I was inspired by their character designs and wanted to implement their chibi versions. One of the goals of this project was to learn how to use the clipping mask tool in Adobe Illustrator.

    <figcaption>Ichigo Kurosaki Playing Card. 1/2 special designs I did as he is one of my favorite characters. As the main protagonist of the series Bleach, I made the design different by using his main colors black and orange.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>Rin Okumura Playing Card. This is the second special design I did for my playing card designs. For this I used Rin's blue and black with a silhouette  of him and his Kurikara katana. </figcaption>

  <img src="/images/KingDiavolo-1.jpg" alt="Obey Me: Diavolo Playing Card">
    <figcaption>Diavolo: King of Devildom - Obey Me Character. This and the following are more simple as the focus are the characters chibi versions. I chose Diavolo specifically for the king card as he is the crowned prince and stand in king of the fictional world of Devildom from the game Obey Me. </figcaption>

  <img src="/images/JokerMammon-1.jpg" alt="Obey Me: Mammon Playing Card">
    <figcaption>Mammon: Avatar of Greed - Obey Me Character. As Mammon is one of my favorite characters from the game Obey Me, I wanted to use him as part of this collection. I chose to make him a joker because while he often acts like a clueless and selfish clown, he is quite powerful and a great person once you see past his initial image.</figcaption>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/KingOfClubs-1.jpg" alt="Obey Me: Satan Playing Card">
    <figcaption>Satan: Avatar of Wrath - Obey Me Character. Another character from the game Obey Me, Satan. I also used him as a king card just like Diavolo but went with king of clubs because it symbolizes strength, power and determination which are things Satan possesses.</figcaption>
  </img>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/AceSolomon-1.jpg" alt="Obey Me: Solomon Playing Card">
    <figcaption>Solomon: The Wise One; Most Powerful Sorcerer - Obey Me Character. For the final Obey Me character, i chose possibly the most powerful characters in the franchise. Solomon is an over powered sorcerer with a history going back centuries. For this reason, I chose the Ace as his representation as it is more powerful in a deck than even the king.</figcaption>
