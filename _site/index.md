<h1> Meet Moni: The Mind Behind the 'Scape</h1>
<p>
  I am Tasia Miller, the creator of Moni’s Mindscape. I came up with this title because I think of my digital work as a different part of me that I would like to bring to life from the ever-active reaches of my mind. Moni is a nickname I’ve given myself based on my middle name. I went to university for Computer Information Sciences, and Multimedia Production and Design. I hope to become someone proficient in the arts of graphic design, website development, and software engineering so that one day I can sit on an island far away with my cat Mochi. Welcome to my little slice of heaven. :)
