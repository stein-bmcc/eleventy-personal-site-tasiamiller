<h1> Meet Moni: The Mind Behind the 'Scape</h1>
<p>
  I am Tasia Miller, the creator of Moni’s Mindscape. I came up with this title because I think of my digital work as a different part of me from the ever-active reaches of my mind. Moni is a nickname I’ve given myself based on my middle name. I am an inspiring multimedia artist based in New York City. I studied Computer Information Sciences, and Multimedia Production and Design. I am passionate about Graphic Design and Web Development.  Welcome to my little slice of heaven. :)
