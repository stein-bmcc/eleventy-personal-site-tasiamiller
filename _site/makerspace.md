<h1>
Makerspace Campaign Project
</h1>
<p>
For this project, I teamed up with my classmates Loverta Brown and Nicole Duque in making a campaign that brought awareness to the BMCC Makerspace. This was an assignment that took place in our Multimedia Project Lab class in Spring of 2023. 
</p>
<p>
There were a few problems involving the Makerspace. The main problem at hand is that the Makerspace doesn’t have a constant stream of funding which makes it very difficult for the lab manager, Kar Rosen, to stay employed and properly compensated for their work for the Makerspace. Another problem is that not many students know about the Makerspace, therefore aren’t utilizing the equipment often and most only learn of the space during their final semester if at all. We aim to make sure that not only will the Makerspace get more attention through physical products and posters but also make sure that the Makerspace lab manager stays employed since they know best how to use the equipment. 
</p>

<p>My position was product designing, which ended up being the pop-up card but before getting to that, we had a lot of things to do before we got to that. As this was a group project, we all pitched in for certain aspects of the project such as working on the flyer designs and product assembly.  We created several iterations of both the workkshop and universal flyers and these are my drafts:  </p>

<p>    For this project, we created a campaign involving one or more multimedia types to help widen how many people interact with our focus. From the beginning we decided we wanted to do flyers (both digital and physical); acrylic keychains or pin badges; a workshop event and a pop-up card. For the acrylic keychains and badges, we got to host our workshop event for fellow BMCC (Borough of Manhattan Community College) students and guide them through designing their keychains or badges which were made using the Makerspace’s laser cuter run by the lab manager, Kar. </p>

<p>For the physical product we did a pop-up card, as it was something different and would add an interesting touch to our project. As this was the part of the project that I was in charge of, I drafted rough ideas of what our card would look like.</p>
