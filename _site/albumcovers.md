<h1>
K-Pop Album Design Concepts
</h1>
<p>
In my free time <em>and even sometimes while I'm busy</em>, I enjoy listening to music as I finish tasks that don't require listening to lectures or simple things that let me turn my brain off. While I enjoy most music, I mainly listen to Korean pop or hip hop as I've been learning the language. Because of this, I often gain a surge of creativity and as I like creating fun story lines as well, I began to make my own imaginary k=pop groups and began envisioning what their albums would look like.

  <img src="/images/cherrylimeade.jpg" alt="Redhot Subunit Cherry Limeade Album Art">
    <figcaption>This album was created for Redhot's only subunit Cherry Limeade. The focus for this was more upbeat and summery with a touch of retro. I used a pattern of 8-bit cherries and limes to tie in the subunit's name, <em>Cherry Limeade</em>, as the album's name is <i>'Cherry Rush'</i>.</figcaption>

  <img src="/images/switch-polaris.jpg" alt=" Polaris Switch Album Cover">
    <figcaption>This album design is for my fictional group <em>Polaris</em>, a co-ed duo consisting of members Shin Daehwan and Kim Sorin. The name <em> Switch </em> comes from the pair going for a sound that is different from their usual music,<i>switching</i> up their sound for their first full sized album.</figcaption>

  <img src="/images/personal-daehwan.jpg" alt="Polaris' Shin Daehwan solo debut album 'Personal'">
    <figcaption> This album design is for a member of my first fictional group, <em>Polaris</em>, Shin Daehwan. To match his personality, the design focuses on simplicity and cool tones as he is very down-to-earth and is not one to be overly flashy. The person in the image is Kang Insoo of <em>MyName</em>,a k-pop group who debuted in 2011.</figcaption>

  <img src="/images/redhot.jpg" alt="Redhot's mini album Hottest">
    <figcaption>This design is for my fictional group Redhot. This is intented to be their first mini album as they previously only released digital singles. The focal point for this was <i> Hot Pink</i> by the existing girl group <em>EXID</em> in which the music video showcases of viscous pink substance. I took inspiration from that and used a black drips over a glittery hot pink center to add edge.

  <img src="/images/Crystalite.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>This design is for my fictional boy group Code:Blue. They are intended to be the brother group to Redhot, essentially being their opposites concept wise. While Redhot represents heat with their confidence and ambition, Code:Blue is intended to represent a cooler side with their sincerity and enthusiasm. <em>Crystalite</em> showcases this using different shades of blue on a snowy backdrop. </figcaption>
