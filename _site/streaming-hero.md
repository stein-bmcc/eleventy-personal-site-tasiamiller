      STREAMING SITE HERO BANNERS
  </h1>
  
  <p>
  Two hero design banners:
      1. A banner for a movie and television streaming site. I think there is a large audience who still prefers to enjoy movies at home rather than in stuffy theaters with screaming kids and couples canoodling so I used that as my focus.
  
  2. A banner for a music streaming site. I was inspired to include a bit more information (“your recent listens”) by using Spotify’s approach. The album designs are original pieces created by my friend and I.
