<h1>
STREAMING SITE HERO BANNERS
</h1>
<p>
Two hero design banners:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A banner for a movie and television streaming site. I think there is a large audience who still prefers to enjoy movies at home rather than in stuffy theaters with screaming kids and couples canoodling so I used that as my focus.
</li>
<li> A banner for a music streaming site. I was inspired to include a bit more information (“your recent listens”) by using Spotify’s approach. The album designs are original pieces created by my friend and I.
</li>
</ol>
